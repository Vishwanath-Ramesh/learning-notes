1. Compound Components
Compound components is a pattern in which components are used together such that they share an implicit state that let’s them communicate with each other in the background.

2. Render prop
The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. More concretely, a render prop is a function 
prop that a component uses to know what to render. Also, any prop that is a function that a component uses to know what to render is technically a “render prop”.

3. State reducer
It provides control over the state of the component.
Eg: Suppose we have a component called 'Toggle' with the state variable for controlling the 'ON/OFF' value. If we are using this component in another component, we can have
control over the state variable by using the state reducer function implemented in the consumer component and passing as a prop to the Toggle component.
