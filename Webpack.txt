Install webpack & CLI
	> webpack webpack-cli --dev
	
Webpack Configuration
	const path = require('path');

	module.exports = {
	  entry: './src/index.js',
	  output: {
		filename: 'main.js',
		path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
	  },
	};
	
NPM Scripts
	build - webpack
	
Loaders
	CSS
		yarn add --dev style-loader css-loader
	module: {
		rules: [
		  {
			test: /\.css$/,
			use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
		  },
		],
	  },		

Plugins
	Cleaning up the /dist folder on each build	
		Install
			> yarn add --dev clean-webpack-plugin
		Code in webpack.config.js
			const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require('clean-webpack-plugin');
			
			plugins: [new CleanWebpackPlugin()],

	If we changed the name of one of our entry points, or even added a new one? The generated bundles would be renamed on a build, but our index.html file would still reference the old names. 
	Let's fix that with the HtmlWebpackPlugin.
		Install
			> yarn add --dev html-webpack-plugin
		Code in webpack.config.js
			const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

			plugins: [
				new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
				title: 'Output Management',
			}),
			]
		
		To use custom template for starup HTML page, configure below option in plugin
			template: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/index.html'),

		
Source Map
	- In order to make it easier to track down errors and warnings, JavaScript offers source maps, which map your compiled code back to your original source code. 
	If an error originates from b.js, the source map will tell you exactly that.
	- Code in webpack.config.js
		devtool: 'inline-source-map'
		
Dev Server
	Install
		> yarn add --dev webpack-dev-server
	Code in webpack.config.js
		devServer: {
			contentBase: './dist',
		}
	Options
		Inline - Adds “Live reloading” for the entire page
			inline: true,
		Hot - Enables “Hot Module Reloading” that tries to reload just the component that’s changed (instead of the entire page).
		If we pass both options, then, when the source changes, the webpack-dev-server will try to HMR first. If that doesn’t work, then it will reload the entire page.
