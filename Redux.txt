Redux
    - Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
    - Redux is a library for managing global application state in application
    - uses a "one-way data flow" app structure
    - The whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single store
    - The only way to change the state tree is to create an action, an object describing what happened, and dispatch it to the store
Action
    - It's just a plain javascript object which describes what happened
Reducers
    - Reducers are functions that calculate a new state value based on previous state + an action
Store
    - A Redux store runs the root reducer whenever an action is dispatched

Slice
     It is a collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a single feature in your app, typically defined together in a single file
