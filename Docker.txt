Why Docker
    - It's make it really easy to install sofwares on any given machine

What is Docker
    - Docker is a platform for creating and running containers

Containers
    - Instance of an image/program
    - It is a combination of software program, kernel and portion of HD, memory, RAM etc

Image 
    - It's single file gets stored on a harddrive/system containing all the necessary things to run a particular program.
    - We use this image to create a container 
    - Eg : Redis

Namespacing
    - Isolating resources per process. i.e this area of HD is for that process and that for another
    Eg : Having multiple versions of python installed, so that chrome can use python v2, and NodeJS use python v3

Control groups
    - Limit the amount of resources that the process can use

Commands
    docker version
    docker run hello-world
