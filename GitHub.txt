Git Version
    $ git Version

Set git global variables
    $ git config --global user.name "Vishwanath"
    $ git config --global user.email "vishwanathr.dev@outlook.com"

List global config variables
    $ git config --global --list

Clone git repository
    $ git clone https://github.com/Vishwanath-Ramesh/github-tutorial.git

Get status of the git repository
    $ git status

To add the file to the staging area
    $ git add sample.txt

To add multiple file recursively to the staging area
    $ git add .

To remove/unstage the changes back to working directory from staging area
    $ git reset HEAD sample.txt

Commit changes from the staging area to the local git repository
    $ git commit -m "Added the simple file"

Adding & Commiting the changes at one shot(Express commit)
    $ git commit -am "Add & Commit"

To checkout/get latest version for a particular file(Revert back to recently commited state)
    $ git checkout -- sample.txt

Push changes from local repository to github repository
    $ git push origin master

Pull changes from remote git repository to our working directory i.e., get latest version
    $ git pull origin master

Show contents of git config file in user directory
    $ cat ~/.gitconfig

Edit the config file using the default configured editor
    $ git config --global -e

Create repository from cmd
    $ git init repo-from-cmd

Initialize git with already existing directory
    $ cd /source-directory
    $ git init

List of files that git is tracking in the current repository
    $ git ls-files
    $ ls -al

Rename file name 
    $ git mv sample.txt demo.txt

If a particular file was renamed/moved/deleted at a OS level, then following command can be used to track the renamed/moved/deleted files also used to add the files recursively.
    $ git add -A 

If we renamed a files and it's not been added to the staging area yet, we can simply rename back to the original file name instead of reset/checkout.
    $ git mv demo.txt sample.txt

If there are multiples files that need to be staged after renamed/moved/deleted and we want to stage only one file, we add that particular file first and then update the index of that files
    $ git add -u

We cant delete the file using the below command if the file has not been added to the staging area instead we need to use os level commands.
    $ git rm sample.txt

If a git tracking file is deleted by os level, git doesn't know the deletion or changes made. For that wee need to update the changes in git    
    $ git add -A

Git help
    $ git help log

Add new git remote
    If a new repo was created in cmd line which needs to commited in remote repo following cmd can be used.
    $git remote add origin https://github.com/Vishwanath-Ramesh/learning-notes.git

    $ git log
    $ git log --oneline
    $ git log --all --oneline --graph --decorate - Plain commits
    $ git log --since="3 days ago" - Get commits from 3 days before.
    $ git log -- sample.txt - Show commits for the specified file
    $ git show [commit id] - Shows whats changed in particular commit

Alias
    $ git config --global alias.history "log --all --oneline --graph --decorate"

Configure Merge/Diff tool

    $ git config --global mergetool.p4merge.path "C:/p4merge.exe"
    $ git config --global mergetool.promp false

    $ git config --global diff.tool p4merge
    $ git config --global difftool.p4merge.path "C:/p4merge.exe"
    $ git config --global difftool.promp false

Comparisions
    Command line results of changes in working directory and staging area.
        $ git diff
    Working directory Vs Staging area
        $ git difftool
    Working directory vs git repository(.git/Last commit)
        $ git difftool HEAD
    To compare Staging area vs repository(.git/Last commit)
        $ git difftool --staged HEAD
    Compare between different commits
        $ git difftool abcde xyz42
    Compare HEAD and HEAD-1
        $ git difftool HEAD HEAD^
    Compare local master branch and remote master branch
        $ git difftool master origin/master
    Limit the no of files to compare
        $ git difftool -- README.md

Branching & Merging
    List branches in local alone
        $ git branch
    List all the branches in local and remote(* denotes current active branch)
        $ git branch -a
    Create a new branch
        $ git branch mynwebranch
    Move to another branch  
        $ git checkout mynwebranch
    Rename branch name  
        $ git branch -m mynewbranch newbranch
    Delete a branch 
        $ git branch -d newbranch        
    Create a new branch from existing branch    
        $ git checkout -b newMasterBranch
    Compare differences between branches    
        $ git diff master newbranch
    Merge changes from source branch into current branch, this is only used when there is no commits in source branch. Also know as fast forward merge  
        $ git merge newbranch - Merges changes from 'newbranch' into current active branch(master). 
    Merge changes from source branch to master with disabled fast forward. Means it has commits done in source branch
        $ git merge newbranch --no-ff
    HEAD - Last commit in a local branch
    origin/HEAD - Last commite on a remote branch

Rebasing
    Including all the changes done in master branch into child branch so that changes done in new branch can be fast forward merge into master branch.
    $(new-branch) git rebase master 

Stashing
    Move the uncommited files to a temporary location, so that those files can be completed in future by reverting the working directory to the recent commit(HEAD) with 
    the hep of stashing.
        $ git stash - Move all the uncommited files to a temporary location and revert back the working directory to previous commit state.
    After completing the changes for the priority task files, we can retrieve back the changes done from temporary location so that we can continue with the changes from there on.
        $ git stash apply
    In order to clear the stash once all the in-progress task gets completed.
        $ git stash drop
    List all the files in stash
        $ git stash list
    Include un-tracked and commited file for stashing
        $ git stash -u
    Express way of doing Apply and drop on stash    
        $ git stash pop
    In case of multiple stash, to provide name for the stash to differentiate
        $ git stash save "New stash"
    Show the specific stash 
        $ git stash show stash@{1}
    Apply/Continue with the specific stash from the different stash list
        $ git stash apply stash@{1}
    Drop specific stash
        $ git stash drop stash@{2}
    Empty or clear all the available stashes
        $ git stash clear
    To move all the changes in stash into a new branch and drop the changes from stash  
        $ git stash branch newBranchFromStash

Tagging
    A key reference for a specific commit

    Create a lighweight Tag - Tags the most recent commit(HEAD)
        $ git tag newTag
    To get the list of available tags
        $ git tag --list
    Shows the specific tag  
        $ git tag myTag
    Delete a tag
        $ git tag --delete myTag
    Annotated tag - Similar to lighweight tag with little extra information.
        $ git tag -a v-1.0 
    Comparing two different tags    
        $ git diff v-1.1 v-1.1
    Tag specific commit 
        $ git tag -a myTag 5R77tE
    Update/Move the tag from one commit to another commit
        $ git tag -a v-1.1 -f 9R77tE
    Push specific tag to github
        $ git push origin v-1.1
    Push the tags all at once
        $ git push origin master --tags
