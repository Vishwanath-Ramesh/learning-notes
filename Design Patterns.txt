Coupling
    How classes or software components are bound to each other.
    Types
        1. Loosely coupled
            Each & Every class is independent of each other
        2. Tightly coupled
            One or more classes are dependent on another class. In that case, we have re-compile all the dependent classes if any change is made in one of the classes.
            To ovecome this, we can use interfaces.

Interface
    Interfaces are contracts which specifies the capabilities that a class should provide.
    Mainly used to build Loosely coupled softwares
