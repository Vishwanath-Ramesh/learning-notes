JavaScript
  - Dynamically typed language
  - It determines the type during the run time

Primitive Types
  - A type of data that represents single value. That's not an object
  - There are 6 primitive types in JavaScript
    1. undefined - Lack of existense
    2. null - Lack of existense
    3. boolean
    4. number
    5. string
    6. symbol
  - SNOB'N'US
    String
    Number
    Objects
    Boolean
    Null
    Undefined
    Symbol

Single Threaded
  - One command at a time.
  - The execution of instructions in a single sequence

Synchronous 
  - One at a time in order
  
Lexical Environment
  - Every time the JavaScript engine creates an execution context to execute the function or global code, it also creates a new lexical environment to store the variable defined in that function during the execution of that function.
  - A lexical environment is a data structure that holds identifier-variable mapping.
  - A Lexical Environment has two components: (1) the environment record and (2) a reference to the outer environment. The environment record is the actual place where the variable and function declarations are stored. The reference to the outer environment means it has access to its outer (parent) lexical environment.
  - Where something sits physically in the code
  Eg: Variable declaration inside a function. That is, the variable sits lexically inside the function.

Execution Context
  - This is where the code actually starts and run
  - It creates the global object called 'this'
  - In browser, each tab is a seperate execution context which in turn has seperate global object
  - There are two phases  
    1. Creation phase
    2. Execution phase

Hoisting
  - Logically, during the creation phase, the JavaScript engine moves the variable and function declarations to the top of your code. But technically, they are stored in
  the memory(heap).
  - Variables using 'var' are initialized with 'undefined' during the creation phase but the 'let' does not. 
  - Functions are also stored in memory during the creation phase not anonymous or arrow function.

Variables
  1. let
    - It's a block scope
    - We can not redeclare a variable
  2. var
    - It's either function-scoped or global-scoped
    - We can redeclare a variable any number of times
    - It is used in older days to create private variables using IIFE
  3. const
    - Block scoped

N.1
    - Initially always there will be a Global execution context.
    - Setup memory space for variables and Functions - "Hoisting".
    - JavaScript will create an Execution Context before executing any code.
    - The creation of Execution context involves 2 phases, creation and Exection phase.
    - In creation phase, JavaScript sets up memory space for variables and Functions and where they are actually created. For variables, the values 
      are Initially set to 'undefined' and for Functions, they are created as it is.
    - In Exection phase, JavaScript begins to execute the code with the created memory space.

N.3
  -'==' are coersive whereas '===' aren't.
    Coersive - Automatically converts the operands based on the other operand. 
    Eg : false == 0 -> false will be converted to '0'

Operators
  typeof - Tells what type is.

Use strict mode
  - Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
  - include 'use strict'; in wherever scope it's needed.

Disable ESLint
  - /* eslint-disable */ at the top of the file

Escape character
  - Backslash(\)

Breaks
  - Normal Breaks
    Eg : "Aaaa\
          BBB"
    Output : AaaaBBB

  - Line Breaks
    Eg : `Aaaa
          Bbbb'
    Output: Aaaa  
            Bbbb

String Interpolation
  Eg : "My name is ${firstName}."

Hoisting
  - Initially always there will be a Global execution context.
  - Setup memory space for variables and Functions - "Hoisting".
  - JavaScript will create an Execution Context before executing any code.
  - The creation of Execution context involves 2 phases, creation and Exection phase.
  - In creation phase, JavaScript sets up memory space for variables and Functions and where they are actually created. For variables, the values 
    are Initially set to 'undefined' and for Functions, they are created as it is.
  - In Exection phase, JavaScript begins to execute the code with the created memory space.

Imperative Vs Declarative programming
  Imperative
	- Explicitly showing how everything is achieved(step by step process).
  Declarative
	- It only focus on what something is done rather how it's done.
  
Coersion
  - Converting a value from one type to another
  Eg : 1 + '2' => '12'   false < 1 => true    false == 0 => true

Functions
  - Functions are 1st class citizens in JavaScript
  - Meaning, everything you can do with other types can also be done with functions

Functional Programming
  Higher order Functions
    A functions which takes another function as an argument or returns a function is said to be a HOF.
  Function Composition
    Nested function arguments call in a function. 
    Eg : wrapInDiv(toLowerCase(trim(input)));
    Since there are too many paranthesis here. So to overcome this we use a 3rd party library called lodash.
      To install lodash - npm i lodash
      
      import {compose, pipe } from 'lodash/fp';

      cosnt transform = compose(wrapInDiv, toLowerCase, trim);
      transform(input);
    
    But in compose, the order of functions should be treated in reverse order. So to overcome this,
      const transform = pipe(trim, toLowerCase, wrapInDiv);
      pipe(input);
  
  Pure Functions
    A function returns same value every time when we pass a particular value all the time.

  Inheritance
    One object gets access to the properties and methods of another object

  Prototypes 
    Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.

  Reflection
    An object can look at itself, listing and changing its properties and methods.
    In other words, reflection is the ability of a program to manipulate variables, properties, and methods of objects at runtime

  Proxy
    A Proxy object wraps another object and intercepts operations, like reading/writing properties and others, optionally handling them on its own, or transparently allowing the object to handle them

  Immutable
    Can't be modified once it's created.
    In JavaScript, Objects and arrays are immutable.
    JavaScript is not a pure Functional Programming language. So we use 3rd party library(ImmutableJS/ImmerJS/MoriJS) to work with objects and arrays.
    To install ImmutableJS,
      npm i immutable
  
  ImmerJS
    Since ImmutableJS looks ugly because it requires getter & setter for creating the objects. So we go for ImmerJS
    To install ImmerJS
      npm i ImmerJS

    Import {produce} from 'immer';
    book = {name: 'abc'};
    const updated = produce(book, updateBook => {
      updateBook.isPublished = true;
    })

	 componentDidMount
      2. Updating
	 shouldComponentUpdate
	 render
	 componentDidUpdate
      3. Unmounting

ES5 vs ES6
    - ES5
    	- It's the 5th edition of Ecma script, introduced in 2009.
    	- It supports only primitive data types like SNOB'N'S.
    	- Variables can be created only by using 'var'
	- It has lower performance
	- function and return keywords are used to define a function.
    - ES5
    	- It's the 5th edition of Ecma script, introduced in 2015
    	- It's support a new datatype called Symbol
    	- Variables can be created by using 'let' and 'const'
	- It has higher performance
	- We can create a new function without function and return keyword using arrow function

Symbol
    - Symbols are often used to add unique property keys to an object
    - A symbol is a primitive which cannot be recreated

What is HTML Canvas
    - It is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.

How do I loop through or enumerate a JavaScript object?
    1. for in - Iterates over entire property chain
    2. Object.entries, keys, values - Iterates only for the object properties

for..in vs for..of
    - for..in
	- Iterates over the enumerable properties of the object and returns list of 'keys'
	- Can be used with objects
	- Can be used with Arrays and string but not advisable
    - for..of
	- Iterates over the iterable collections of the object and returns list of 'values'
	- Can not be used with objects
	- Can be used with Arrays and string

CSS Box Model
    - The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

Flexbox vs. CSS Grid

Promise states
    1. Pending
    2. fulfilled
    3. Rejected
    4. Settled

Functional Components VS Class Components
    - Functional components
	- It is also called stateless component
	- It's just a regular function without any boilerplate code
	- It doesn't support any lifecycle methods but with hooks, it'll
    - Class components
	- It is also called statefull component
	- It has boilerplate code like extends, constructor etc.,
	- It has an inbuilt support for lifecycle methods

Presentational vs container
  Presentational
  - Also called dumb, stateless
  - concerned with how things look
  - Its only responsibility is to present something to the DOM
  - Its doesn’t have internal state to manage
  - Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props

  container
  - Also called smart, stateful 
  - concerned with how things work
  - Provide the data and behavior to presentational or other container components
  - Are often stateful

HTML5 features
    - header, footer, section, video, nav, figure, canvas

Arrow Funtion Vs Regular Function
    Arrow function
        - It doesn’t define its own execution context, so the value of this is always equals to the outer function's this value
        - It can't be used as a constructor
	- Same like 'this', using 'arguments' results the outside function arguments, not able to access the 'arguments' of it's immediate parameters, but can be used rest operator parameter instead.
	- Explicitly returns if only one statement is present inside the function.
	- Inside a class, 'this' can be referenced in any arrow functions

    Regular function
        - the value of this depends on how the function is invoked
        - Can be used as a constructor
	- Can able to access 'arguments'.
	- Here, returns undefined if no return statement is provided
	- 'this' can't be accessed inside class, so manual binding is required. Eg: func.bind(obj)

Keys in React
    - Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed

Refs
    - Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements

Render Props
    - It's a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.
    - a render prop is a function prop that a component uses to know what to render

HOC vs Render prop
    - It is possible two HOC could be using the same prop meaning one would overwrite the other silently
    - Boilerplate code like setting the displayName with the HOC function name e.g. (withHOC(Component)) to help with debugging
    - Ensure all relevant props are passed through to the component
    - It is easy to compose several HOCs together and then this creates a deeply nested tree making it difficult to debug

Synthetic Event
    - It's a cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event. It has the same interface as the browser’s native event.

Event bubbling
    - When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.

Code splitting
    - If we have more 3rd party dependencies in our app, the output bundle will become large and make the app takes a long time to load.
    - Code-Splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack, Rollup and Browserify, where it'll split the bundle into multiple chunks which can be dynamically loaded at runtime. 

document.createDocumentFragment()
	- Suppose we have huge list items which are appended to the DOM element dynamically using append, there may be some issue in performance wise.
	  So instead, we can use DocumentFragment, which only append to the DOM only after DOM has dynamically created completely.

document.querySelector('p').insertAdjacentHTML('beforebegin', '<li>test</li>')
	- For performance reasons, using template string with innerHTML or appending to the element dynamically cause issues.
	- So, we can use insertAdjacentHTML for that.

replaceWith
	- Replace one element with the other
	Eg: div.replaceWith(newDiv)

cloneNode
	- Creates a copy of DOM node.
	- div.cloneNode(false) or div.cloneNode() clones only the top element.
	- div.cloneNode(true) clones entire tree.

remove
	- Remove DOM node
	Eg: div.remove()
	
bind
  - It creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value.
  Eg : Refer code file

call
  - It calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually.
  Eg : Refer code file

apply
  - It calls a function with a given this value, and arguments provided as an array
  Eg : Refer code file

Pure Functions
	- For the given input, the function returns the same output always.
	- It does not depend on any data outside/inside the function
	- It doesn't have any side effects.

Closures
	- Data of the outside function can be accessible in the inside function eventhough the outer function has returned.

Higher Order Functions(HOF)
	- It takes a function as argument and returns another function.

Currying
	- It is a HoF which transforms function like func(a, b, c) into func(a)(b)(c).
  - Creating a copy of a function but with some preset parameters
