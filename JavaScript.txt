Variables
  - var - Function scoped
  - let - Block scoped
  - const - Block scoped

Types
  SNOB'N'US
  String
  Number
  Objects
  Boolean
  Null
  Undefined
  Symbol

Operators
  typeof - Tells what type is.



Use strict mode
  - 'use strict mode'; at the top of the file.

Disable ESLint
  - /* eslint-disable */ at the top of the file

Escape character
  - Backslash(\)

Breaks
  - Normal Breaks
    Eg : "Aaaa\
          BBB"
    Output : AaaaBBB

  - Line Breaks
    Eg : `Aaaa
          Bbbb'
    Output: Aaaa  
            Bbbb

String Interpolation
  Eg : "My name is ${firstName}."

Hoisting
  - Initially always there will be a Global execution context.
  - Setup memory space for variables and Functions - "Hoisting".
  - JavaScript will create an Execution Context before executing any code.
  - The creation of Execution context involves 2 phases, creation and Exection phase.
  - In creation phase, JavaScript sets up memory space for variables and Functions and where they are actually created. For variables, the values 
    are Initially set to 'undefined' and for Functions, they are created as it is.
  - In Exection phase, JavaScript begins to execute the code with the created memory space.

N.3
  -'==' are coersive whereas '===' aren't.
    Coersive - Automatically converts the operands based on the other operand. 
    Eg : false == 0 -> false will be converted to '0'

Imperative Vs Declarative programming
  Imperative
	- Explicitly showing how everything is achieved(step by step process).
  Declarative
	- It only focus on what something is done rather how it's done.

Functional Programming
  Higher order Functions
    A functions which takes another function as an argument or returns a function is said to be a HOF.
  Function Composition
    Nested function arguments call in a function. 
    Eg : wrapInDiv(toLowerCase(trim(input)));
    Since there are too many paranthesis here. So to overcome this we use a 3rd party library called lodash.
      To install lodash - npm i lodash
      
      import {compose, pipe } from 'lodash/fp';

      cosnt transform = compose(wrapInDiv, toLowerCase, trim);
      transform(input);
    
    But in compose, the order of functions should be treated in reverse order. So to overcome this,
      const transform = pipe(trim, toLowerCase, wrapInDiv);
      pipe(input);
  
  Pure Functions
    A function returns same value every time when we pass a particular value all the time.

  Immutable
    Can't be modified once it's created.
    In JavaScript, Objects and arrays are immutable.
    JavaScript is not a pure Functional Programming language. So we use 3rd party library(ImmutableJS/ImmerJS/MoriJS) to work with objects and arrays.
    To install ImmutableJS,
      npm i immutable
  
  ImmerJS
    Since ImmutableJS looks ugly because it requires getter & setter for creating the objects. So we go for ImmerJS
    To install ImmerJS
      npm i ImmerJS

    Import {produce} from 'immer';
    book = {name: 'abc'};
    const updated = produce(book, updateBook => {
      updateBook.isPublished = true;
    })
