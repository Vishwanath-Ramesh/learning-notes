Algorithms
    - A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

    Sorting
        1. Bubble Sort
            - Compare the current element with the next element and swap them accordingly by looping through the entire array repeatedly until all the 
            elements are sorted.

        2. Insertion Sort
            - Create a sub-array with first element as initial, compare that sub-array with the rest of the right most elements and swap them. If swapped, compare the 
            elements present in the sub-array and do swapping. Then proceed with the next element on the right most of the sub array.

        3. Selection Sort
            - Initialize the first element in an array with a pointer(Represents the smallest element in an array).
            - Loop through the entire array and mark the smallest element with the pointer.
            - Move the smallest/pointered element to the beginning and mark the pointer to the next element of that sub array. Then continue the same until
            all the elements are sorted.
