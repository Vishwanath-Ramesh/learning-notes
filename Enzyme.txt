Mount/Full Rendering
    - It is ideal for use cases where you have components that may interact with DOM APIs, use React lifecycle methods or need to test components that are wrapped in higher order components.
    - Full DOM rendering requires that a full DOM API be available at the global scope.This means that it must be run in an environment that at least “looks like” a browser environment.
    - It mounts the component in the DOM.
    - It can include child components.
    - Allows access to both props directly passed into the root component (including default props) and props passed into child components.

Shallow Rendering
    - Renders only the single component, not including its children.
    - Do have access to lifecycle methods by default.
    - Cannot access props passed into the root component (therefore also not default props), but can those passed into child components.

Static Rendering
    - This 'render' function generate HTML from your React tree, and analyze the resulting HTML structure.
    - Does not have access to React lifecycle methods.
