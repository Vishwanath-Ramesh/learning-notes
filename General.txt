Test Driven Development
	- It is a software development process where we write test cases before writing code.
	- requirements are turned into test cases then the software is developed and improved to pass tests

RGR Cycle
	- Red, Green and Refactor
	Red : Write tests that fail
	Green : Make the test pass by writing the necessary code
	Refactor : Cleanup the code written and make the tests pass

Regression testing
	- Regression testing is re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs after a change. 
	- If not, that would be called a regression.
